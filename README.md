# Architecture JEE and Middleware

Welcome to the Architecture JEE and Middleware repository! This repository hosts a collection of JAVA JEE & Spring Projetcs
## Projects

### 1. Dependency Injection and Inversion of Control Implementation
This project showcases the implementation of dependency injection using both static instantiation (creating objects using `new`) and dynamic instantiation (utilizing configuration files and Spring framework through its XML and annotation-based methods). It emphasizes the importance of loose coupling over tight coupling by relying on interfaces rather than concrete classes, thereby enhancing the maintainability of the application.


### 2. Hibernate ORM Implementation with Spring Data

This repository demonstrates the implementation of Hibernate ORM using Spring Data, focusing on JPA entities, JpaRepository, database configuration, and creating RESTful APIs.

Technologies Used: Java, Spring Data JPA, Hibernate ORM, H2 Database (for testing), MySQL.
